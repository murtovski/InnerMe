# Testing

I built the page starting with a full desktop size and tested it's funtionality, once this was completed I began to test responsiveness for different screen sizes. I used the web editor to change the screen size to some popular widths and ensured that the site responded as intended.

## Validator Testing

### html validator
No errors show in the w3 validator.

### css validator
The css validator successfully tested the project and has no issues.


## Unfixed Bugs
All bugs were removed and validators show no errors. There was an error with a stray script tag but i moved it to the head of the html file and the error stopped.
