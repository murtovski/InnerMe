            <ul>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Keep a consistent sleep schedule</h4>
                    Try to go to sleep and wake up at about the same times every day — even on weekends. This reinforces your body’s sleep cycle (your internal clock), which can make it easier for you to fall asleep and wake up every day.
                    Sticking to a consistent schedule may also help reduce daytime sleepiness.
                    Make sure that the bedtime you pick allows you to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.</li>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Create a relaxing bedtime routine — and stick with it</h4>
                    A relaxing bedtime routine helps you unwind so you’re ready to sleep. And keeping a consistent routine helps your body recognize that it’s bedtime when you start the routine. This may help you fall asleep more quickly.</li>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Turn off electronic devices before you go to sleep</h4>
                    Electronic devices like your phone emit blue light, which can reduce the melatonin levels in your body.</li>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Exercise regularly</h4>
                    As little as 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per day can improve your sleep quality, as well as your overall health. And if you can exercise outside, that might increase the benefits even more</li>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Limit your caffeine intake</h4>
                    The effects of caffeine can last 3 to 7 hours after you consume it. This means that your afternoon cup of coffee may keep you awake and alert a lot longer than you’d like.</li>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Make your sleep environment work for you</h4>
                    A cool, dark, quiet room may help you fall asleep and stay asleep more easily.
                    For most people, a bedroom temperature between 60°F and 67°F (15.6°C and 19.4°C) is the optimal temperature for sleeping.</li>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Use your bed only for sleep and sex</h4>
                    When you have a comfortable bed, it might be tempting to use it for reading, working, talking on the phone, watching TV, or other activities.</li>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Go to bed only when you’re tired</h4>
                    If you’re not tired, avoid lying in bed while you toss and turn. Instead, try doing a relaxing activity until you start to feel tired, then head to bed.</li>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Limit napping — or avoid it if you can</h4>
                    Napping during the day can make it harder to fall asleep later and may make you more prone to waking up during the night.</li>
                <li class="left-content"><h4>Manage stress before going to bed</h4>
                    Thinking about things you’re worried about can keep you awake at night. To help prevent your worries from keeping you awake:</li>
